Certainly, I can explain the code line by line:

1. `from collections import defaultdict`: This line imports the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. A `defaultdict` is a dictionary-like object that provides a default value for keys that do not exist.

2. `documents = { ... }`: This block defines a dictionary called `documents` where each key represents a document ID, and the associated value is a string representing the content of that document.

3. `inverted_index = defaultdict(list)`: This line initializes an `inverted_index` dictionary as a `defaultdict` with an empty list as the default value. This dictionary will be used to create an inverted index, mapping each unique word (token) to a list of document IDs where that word appears.

4. `for doc_id, text in documents.items():`: This line starts a loop that iterates over each document in the `documents` dictionary, where `doc_id` is the document ID, and `text` is the content of the document.

5. `for token in text.lower().split():`: Inside the loop, this line further iterates over each word (token) in the document's content. It converts the word to lowercase and splits the text into words using spaces.

6. `inverted_index[token].append(doc_id)`: For each `token` found in a document, this line appends the `doc_id` to the list associated with that `token` in the `inverted_index`. This effectively builds the inverted index by mapping words to the documents where they appear.

7. `query = input("Enter your query : ")`: This line prompts the user to enter a query and stores the input in the `query` variable.

8. `matching_doc_ids = set(inverted_index.get(query.lower(), []))`: This line looks up the `query` (converted to lowercase) in the `inverted_index`. If the `query` is found in the index, it retrieves the list of document IDs where the query word appears. If not found, it defaults to an empty list. The results are converted into a set to remove duplicate document IDs.

9. `if matching_doc_ids:`: This conditional checks if there are matching document IDs for the query. If there are matches, it enters the block.

10. `for doc_id in matching_doc_ids: ...`: Inside the conditional block, this loop iterates over the matching document IDs and prints the document content associated with those IDs.

11. `print(f"Document {doc_id}: {documents[doc_id]}")`: This line prints the document ID and its content.

12. `else: ...`: If there are no matching documents, this block is executed.

13. `print(f"No matching documents found for the query: {query}")`: This line prints a message indicating that no matching documents were found for the entered query.

The code essentially builds an inverted index to quickly look up documents containing specific words and allows users to query for documents containing particular terms. It's a basic information retrieval system.
